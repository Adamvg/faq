This FAQ section aims to cover the flair system and Discord roles, as well as how to gain reputation for your trades in the community.

# What is a flair?

A flair provides you with a tag next to your Reddit username, and a role on Discord, which shows how many trades you've made. This demonstrates your reputation in the community, much like feedback does on eBay. 

**Flairs do not necessarily mean someone is trustworthy** - it is merely intended as a guide. Trade at your own risk.

Your reputation is built up by getting people to confirm your trades on your rep page.

# How do I get a rep page?

To get a flair, you'll need to make a post on [/r/hwsukrep](https://www.reddit.com/r/hwsukrep). The title should be '\<reddit username>'s Rep Page' (e.g. 'mon0tron's rep page'), and the contents should look like this (paste this into Markdown on new Reddit):

```markdown
* 0 Confirmed trades
* Redditor since [Cake Day]

_If you have been linked this page please confirm the username of the OP. Find the trade below and reply confirmed._
```

You can find your cake day on your profile on New Reddit, or use [redditcakeday](https://redditcakeday.com) on Old Reddit.

Once you have a rep page, people can confirm your trades (things you buy/sell in the community) on your rep page - use a comment with the following format, filling in the blanks (use Markdown Mode on new Reddit):

```markdown
* Username: /u/username
* Item:
* Price: 
* Payment method:
* Bought or sold:
* Comments about the trade:
```

To confirm a trade, reply to these comments with "Confirmed". Once a trade has been confirmed, you can edit your original post to update the number of confirmed trades you have.

# I've got some confirmed trades, how do I get a flair?

Simply request this and a moderator will review your rep page, and if everything looks good your flair will be updated!

- If you're on Discord, raise a support ticket using the instructions in #rules, ask for your flair to be updated and provide a link to your rep page. 
- If you're on Reddit, you can [send a modmail requesting a flair update](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FHardwareSwapUK), providing a link to your rep page.

# My rep page has been archived/locked - what do I do?

Make a new rep page with the same format (with the title e.g. mon0tron's 2nd rep page), providing a link to your old rep page in the body of the new post. Your old trades will still count, and you can carry over the number of confirmed trades in the new post.

# My rep page has been removed - what do I do?

[Send a modmail to /r/HardwareSwapUK.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FHardwareSwapUK)
